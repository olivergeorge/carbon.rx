# Carbon.RX

Spreadsheet FRP library.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/carbon/rx/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/carbon/rx)

## Overview

Carbon.RX is a love child of
[Javelin](https://github.com/hoplon/javelin) and
[freactive.core](https://github.com/aaronc/freactive.core).
Carbon's reactive expressions provide glitch-free changes propagation,
fully dynamic dependency graph and they are GC-friendly.
